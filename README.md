# Data Structures COMP20280 Code repository 2019/20
This repository is a summary of my work throughout the Spring semester of the Academic year 2019/20 in the module Data Structures COMP20280. It is a combination of the algorithms and data structures I worked on during the weekly practical session as well as in my own time.

# Getting Started

### IDE or Text Editor
There are many Java IDE or text editors to choose from, this is up to you based on what you feel comfortable with.<br />
Personally, I prefer Eclipse for Java.<br />
[Downloading and using Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)<br />

### Running the tests
Open Eclipse, and create a new Java project.<br />
Right click the newly created src folder.<br />
Click Import..<br />
Click General -> File System -> Next.<br />
Click Browse..<br />
Browse to the folder that contains all the content of the repository.<br />
Select that folder.<br />
Tick all the files.<br />
Click Finish.<br />
Open and run any file that has a main or is a test file.<br />

### Junit Testing
Each concrete implementation has a junit testing file. These files can be identified easily as all of them end start with the name of implementation they are testing and end with **Test.java**. There are 10 of these files.<br />

All of the files including basic testing in the main for ease of use.<br />

# Contents
- There are 52 different files all in the source folder.
- All the file names explain what is in each of them.
- The files include interfaces, abstract classes and regular java classes.

# Notes
- Tests are done in main in the java files, all you have to do is run them.
- The Ass1.java file was a test implementation for the pseudo code I submitted for the first assignment.
- BracketChecker.java is an extra exercise I did to practice data structures.
